            <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Description</h3>
            The Johns Hopkins University is deeply committed to the protection of human research subjects. This commitment begins with comprehensive compulsory education and training of its faculty, student and staff researchers who conduct human subjects research. The course Research Ethics Workshops about responsibilities and duties of scientists (REWards) is designed to address key concepts in human subjects protection in specific research communities. REWards combines lectures and small group discussions to provide practical information on the ethical issues involved in research protocol development and implementation. The predecessor course to REWards was the Course on Research Ethics (C.O.R.E.).
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Course Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Recognize aspects of study design that can be ethically problematic including subject selection, research-related risks, conflicts of interest, and use of vulnerable populations.</li>
            <li>Describe the key concepts in informed consent including respect for autonomy, voluntariness, decision-making capacity, disclosure of information, and understanding.</li>
            <li>Recognize the key concepts in the responsible conduct of research, including data acquisition and management, mentor/trainee responsibilities, publication practices and authorship standards, conflicts of interest and commitment, and scientific misconduct.</li>
        </ul>

        Investigators should note that there are two sets of requirements that they may need to fulfill in order to conduct research:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Human Subjects Research (HSR) training for the Institutional Review Board (IRB)
            </li>
            <li>The School of Medicine Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Program
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Training requirements for the IRB can be found at:<br>
        <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/institutional_review_board/training_requirements/rewards.html" style="text-wrap:wrap">https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/institutional_review_board/training_requirements/rewards.html</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        For more information regarding the School of Medicine RCR Program, please contact the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), Division of Research Integrity at <a href="mailt:integrity@jhmi.edu">integrity@jhmi.edu</a> or visit the <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Research/OPC/Research_Integrity/responsible_conduct_RCRprogram.html">RCR Program</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        REWards is principally designed to help investigators fulfill their training in the protection of human subjects research. Requirements vary based on whether the learner is a student, trainee, fellow, staff member, co-investigator, or principal investigator; what kind of grant support the learner has; and whether the learner is completing initial certification or recertification. Additionally, by attending specific REWards workshops, investigators have the opportunity to work toward completing the School of Medicine RCR Program requirements.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight:bold">Criteria for completing HSR/IRB training requirements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b style="font-weight:bold;">New Principal Investigators(PIs)</b> must complete their requirement to attend REWards within one year from the date of their first eIRB protocol submission as a PI. They must attend 2 workshops to fulfill their training requirement (one on Human Subjects Research and one on the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)). Note that some, but not all, of the RCR workshops also count toward the School of Medicine RCR Program requirements.</li>
            <li><b style="font-weight:bold;"></b>Fellows</b> must complete their requirement to attend REWards by the end of their fellowship, although it is recommended that they attend REWards before or soon after starting their research. They must attend 2 workshops to fulfill their training requirement (one on Human Subjects Research and one on the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)). It is suggested that fellows attend one introductory workshop on human subjects protection, the workshop on The Francis Collins video, and the two RCR workshops offered by the OPC. Note that some, but not all, of the RCR workshops also count toward the School of Medicine RCR Program requirements.</li>
            <li><b style="font-weight:bold;">Principal investigators Needing Recertification</b> have must complete online modules through CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) and one in-person course. PIs who conduct human subjects research must recertify every three years. Information on PI recertification can be found at: <a href="http://lms4.learnshare.com/l.aspx?CID=89&A=1&T=303570">http://lms4.learnshare.com/l.aspx?CID=89&A=1&T=303570</a>. A variety of in-person learning activities are available to investigators to fulfill their in-person requirement including workshops, conferences, and courses. <b style="font-weight:bold;">Any REWards workshop counts toward the in-person course requirement for PI recertification.</b> PI’s needing recertification can choose any workshop they wish.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Co-investigators, research coordinators, and other members of the research team are not required to take REWards but are welcome to attend workshops. In addition to registering with CME, they should also enroll in workshops through myLearning at <a href="https://lms4.learnshare.com/Home.aspx">https://lms4.learnshare.com/Home.aspx.</a>

            <b>Criteria for completing the School of Medicine RCR Program:</b><br>
            The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine has established a <em>Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Program</em>designed to educate all faculty, postdoctoral trainees, and staff engaged in research at JHU SOM on topics related to research integrity. Researchers must complete each component of the RCR Program every four years. The three required components of the RCR Program are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Complete the online <a href="http://lms4.learnshare.com/l.aspx?CID=89&A=2&T=337694">RCR CITI Course.</a></b> The online course, developed by the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI), is comprised of seven modules.  Completion of all modules is required.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/resources/offices-policies/OPC/Research_Integrity/research-integrity-colloquia-main.html">The Research Integrity Colloquia</a>: In this series, JHU SOM faculty discuss their perspectives on approaching and conducting research with integrity.  Interactive presentations covering a broad spectrum of RCR topics are held over the course of the academic year.</li>
